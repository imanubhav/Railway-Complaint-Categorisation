# Railway-Complaint-Categorisation
Untitled2 have 13 Complaints 
Due to increasing number of passengers
in Indian Railways, there are huge
number of complaints in front of Indian
Railways coming every minute.To handle
such a large amount of complaints
require an innovative solution. To counter
this issue, we with the use of Natural
Language Processing are designing a
model that classifies the complaint with
the help of keywords in it into certain
categories and sub-categories. Each
category would have a unique priority
and will be responded accordingly. Thus
enabling Indian Railway at a better
responsiveness towards complaints.
